# Admission Prediction
Training a model that predicts chance of admission of new students.

- We will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on the given data to best describe and understand te problem.
- We will find the top 4 criteria that affect a student's chances of admission.
- We then compare the performance of Linear Regression Model against the performance of a Random Forest Regressor to find the model that gives the best fit.
- We will use RMSE and R-Squared Score to compare the 2 models.

### Conclusion
The linear regression performs better! The RMSE difference between the test set and the training set of the linear regression is very small compared to the one of random forest regression
